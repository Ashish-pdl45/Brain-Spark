                    <h2>01 // Time is the Only Non-Renewable Resource</h2>
                    <p>
                        Time is the only resource you cannot get back. How you spend your days is how you spend your life. You can earn more money. You can build new skills. But you cannot buy more time. This is why time is your most valuable asset.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Yet most people waste their time without thinking about it. They scroll social media. They watch TV. They procrastinate. They fill their days with low-value activities. And then they wonder why their life doesn't feel fulfilled. It's because they haven't been intentional about how they spend their time.
                    </p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>02 // Procrastination is Emotional Regulation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Procrastination is not laziness. It's emotional regulation. You avoid tasks because they make you feel anxious, overwhelmed, or uncertain. Your brain is trying to protect you from discomfort by suggesting easier, more pleasurable activities.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The way to overcome procrastination is not through willpower alone. It's by understanding what emotions the task triggers and developing strategies to manage those emotions. Break the task into smaller pieces. Start with just 5 minutes. Celebrate small wins. Change your environment. Use accountability. These are all tools for emotional regulation.
                    </p>

                    <h2>03 // The Attention Economy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your attention is under constant assault. Tech companies employ armies of engineers whose sole job is to keep you engaged on their platforms. They use psychological principles of variable rewards, social validation, and FOMO to hijack your attention.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Meanwhile, your ability to focus deeply is becoming more rare and more valuable. The ability to do deep work—to spend hours on something that requires your full attention—is a superpower. This is where real achievement happens. Not in multitasking. Not in switching between apps. But in deep focus.
                    </p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>04 // Building Focus Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        Focus is the new currency. In a distracted world, the ability to do deep work is a superpower. But focus doesn't happen by accident. You need to design systems that support it. This means removing distractions, creating accountability, and protecting your time.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Use techniques like the Pomodoro method, time blocking, and environmental design. Turn off notifications. Use apps that block distracting websites. Create a dedicated workspace. Communicate your focus time to others. Every system you build to protect your attention is an investment in your future self.
