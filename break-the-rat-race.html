                    <h2>01 // The Designed Cycle</h2>
                    <p>
                        The rat race is not an accident. It is a designed system of endless consumption and production that keeps you too busy to think and too tired to dream. You work to make money. You spend money on things you don't need to impress people you don't like. Then you work more to buy more things.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        This cycle is maintained by the banking system, marketing, education, and social conditioning. You're taught from childhood that your worth is measured by your productivity, your salary, and your possessions. You're made to believe that you need certain things to be happy. You're kept running on a treadmill where the finish line keeps moving.
                    </p>

                    <h2>02 // From Consumer to Creator</h2>
                    <p>
                        Breaking free requires a fundamental shift in mindset: from consumer to creator. Stop trading time for money. Start building assets that work for you while you sleep. The difference between the poor and the rich is not how hard they work, but what they own.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The poor trade their time for money. They work 40 hours a week for a salary that barely covers their expenses. The rich build businesses, invest in assets, create intellectual property, and generate passive income. This is not about being greedy. It's about understanding the difference between being trapped and being free.
                    </p>

                    <h2>03 // Financial Freedom is Autonomy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Financial freedom is not about luxury. It's about autonomy. The ability to wake up and say 'No' is the ultimate power. When you're financially dependent on a paycheck, you're trapped. You can't speak your truth. You can't take risks. You can't pursue your passion.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The first step is to stop living beyond your means. Stop buying things you can't afford to impress people you don't know. The second step is to develop multiple income streams. The third step is to invest the difference. Over time, your assets will generate more income than your job ever could.
                    </p>

                    <h2>04 // The Path to Freedom</h2>
                    <p>
                        Breaking the rat race requires both tactical and strategic thinking. Tactically, you need to reduce your expenses and increase your income. Strategically, you need to build toward passive income and asset ownership.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        This journey takes time and discipline. But every dollar you don't spend is a dollar working for your freedom. Every skill you develop is an asset that compounds over time. Every relationship you build is a potential opportunity. The rat race is designed to keep you running. But if you're intentional, you can step off the treadmill entirely.
