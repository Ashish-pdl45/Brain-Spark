                    <h2>01 // Feelings, Not Facts</h2>
                    <p>
                        People do not remember what you said. They remember how you made them feel. Emotional intelligence is the key to connection. You can have the most logical argument in the world, but if you haven't connected emotionally, you won't persuade anyone.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        This is why marketing is so powerful. It's not selling you the product—it's selling you the feeling. Apple doesn't sell computers. It sells the feeling of being innovative and different. Nike doesn't sell shoes. It sells the feeling of power and possibility.
                    </p>

                    <h2>02 // The Power of Non-Verbal Communication</h2>
                    <p>
                        Non-verbal cues make up 93% of communication (some say it's less, but the research is clear that it's the majority). Your posture, eye contact, facial expression, and tone speak louder than your words.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        You can say "I'm happy" while your body language conveys sadness. People will trust the body language. This is why politicians and sales people invest so much in training their body language. A slight change in posture, a confident handshake, maintained eye contact—these create an enormous shift in how people perceive you.
                    </p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>03 // Psychological Reactance</h2>
                    <p>
                        When people feel their freedom is threatened, they experience psychological reactance—they resist. If you try to force someone to believe something, they will believe the opposite even more strongly. Understanding this principle is crucial for persuasion.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Rather than telling someone what to believe, ask them questions that lead them to your conclusion. Rather than forcing change, create the conditions for people to choose change. This is how the greatest leaders, teachers, and communicators operate. They don't control. They inspire.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>04 // Ethical Influence</h2>
                    <p>
                        Persuasion is not manipulation. It is the art of aligning your truth with someone else's needs. The most ethical communicators are those who genuinely care about helping the other person. They're not trying to trick anyone. They're trying to solve a real problem.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        When you align your message with the other person's values, when you understand what they truly need, when you deliver on your promises—you build influence that lasts. You build trust. You build loyalty. This is real power.
