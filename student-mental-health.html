                    <h2>01 // The Silent Epidemic</h2>
                    <p>
                        Academic pressure is a silent epidemic. We are teaching students to sacrifice their health for a number on a paper. Young people are experiencing anxiety, depression, and burnout at unprecedented rates. Suicide is a leading cause of death among young adults.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        This is not normal. This is a system failure. We've created an environment where a student's worth is measured by their GPA, their test scores, and their college acceptance. We've created a culture where mental health is ignored in favor of achievement. This is a tragedy.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>02 // Burnout is Not Achievement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Burnout is not a badge of honor. Rest is productive. You cannot pour from an empty cup. Yet students are glorified for pulling all-nighters, for sacrificing sleep, for being "stressed." We celebrate overwork and penalize self-care.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The irony is that burned-out students actually perform worse. They have lower GPAs, they score worse on tests, and they are less creative. Taking care of your mental health is not selfish. It's essential for actually performing well. Sleep, exercise, social connection, and relaxation are not distractions from achievement. They are prerequisites for achievement.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>03 // Your Worth is Not Your Productivity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your worth is not defined by your productivity or your grades. You are a human being, not a human doing. You have inherent value simply by existing. You don't need to earn it. You don't need to prove it.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The pressure to constantly achieve, to constantly be productive, to constantly improve—this is a trap. It's a game designed by systems that benefit from your effort and your anxiety. You don't have to play this game. You can choose a different path.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>04 // Building Resilience</h2>
                    <p>
                        This doesn't mean abandoning all goals or effort. It means building a life that is resilient, balanced, and sustainable. It means setting boundaries. It means saying no to opportunities that don't align with your values. It means prioritizing your mental health above your grades.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Seek help when you need it. Talk to someone. There is no shame in struggling. Every successful person you admire has faced mental health challenges. What separates them is that they didn't suffer in silence. They reached out. They got help. And they continued forward. You can too.
