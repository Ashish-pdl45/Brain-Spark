                    <h2>01 // Industrial Age Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        The modern education system was designed for the industrial age, not the digital age. It was built to produce compliant workers, not independent thinkers. It rewards obedience, not creativity. It punishes failure instead of treating it as a learning opportunity.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Children are forced to sit in rows, follow orders, and regurgitate information that they could instantly find online. The bell system mimics factory shifts. Grades are used as behavioral control. The entire structure is optimized for producing standardized workers, not for developing human potential.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>02 // What Grades Actually Measure</h2>
                    <p>
                        Grades measure your ability to follow instructions, not your intelligence. Real-world problems don't come with multiple-choice answers. Real innovation doesn't come from students who color inside the lines.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The students who get straight A's often struggle in life because they've been trained to optimize for external validation rather than internal drive. They've learned to please the teacher rather than question the system. Meanwhile, many "struggling" students have creativity and intuition that no test can measure.
                    </p>

                    <h2>03 // Self-Education is the Real Education</h2>
                    <p>
                        Self-education is the only education that matters in the 21st century. The internet is the greatest library in human history. You have access to the world's best teachers, the latest research, and unlimited resources—all for free or near-free.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        But self-education requires something school doesn't teach: intrinsic motivation. You must want to learn. You must be curious. You must be willing to fail and learn from your failures. These skills are not developed in a classroom where fear of grades prevents real risk-taking.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>04 // Beyond the System</h2>
                    <p>
                        This doesn't mean education is bad. It means understanding the system you're in and not letting it limit your thinking. You can get good grades AND think independently. You can follow the rules of the game while building skills outside the game.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The students who win in life are those who master the system enough to get their diploma, but who don't let the system define their intelligence or limit their potential. They read widely. They build projects. They fail and learn. They develop skills that no test measures. They follow their curiosity wherever it leads. This is real education.
