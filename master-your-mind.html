                    <h2>01 // The Garden of Your Mind</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your mind is a garden. If you don't plant flowers, weeds will grow. Most mental suffering comes from an untamed mind—a mind that feeds on worry, comparison, and self-doubt. Your thoughts are not facts. Your feelings are not final. But if you don't master your mind, your mind will master you.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The first step to mastery is awareness. Notice your thoughts without judgment. What patterns do you see? What triggers your anxiety? What activates your potential? The quality of your life is determined by the quality of the questions you ask yourself and the thoughts you habitually entertain.

                    <h2>02 // Discipline Over Motivation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment. Motivation is fleeting. It comes and goes. But discipline is consistent. Discipline is the ability to do what needs to be done, whether you feel like it or not.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Most people wait for the perfect motivation to act. But mastery is built through showing up consistently, even when you're tired, even when you're not inspired. This is why champions are built in unglamorous moments—in the 5 AM gym sessions, in the hours of deep work when no one is watching, in the discipline to say no to instant gratification.

                    <h2>03 // Meditation as Mental Practice</h2>
                    <p>
                        Meditation and mindfulness are not spiritual luxuries. They are mental necessities in the age of information overload. Your attention is your most valuable resource, and it's under constant assault from notifications, content, and designed distractions.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Meditation trains your mind to focus, to observe without judgment, and to respond rather than react. Even 10 minutes a day rewires your brain toward greater calm, clarity, and emotional resilience. This is not woo. This is neuroscience. When you meditate, you're literally building new neural pathways.
                    </p>

                    <h2>04 // Emotional Mastery</h2>
                    <p>
                        Emotions are data. They're information about what matters to you and what threatens you. But most people are controlled by their emotions rather than controlling their emotions. They react impulsively and later regret their words and actions.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Master your emotions by understanding them. When you feel angry, ask: what boundary has been violated? When you feel anxious, ask: what am I afraid of? When you feel envious, ask: what do I desire? Once you understand your emotions, you can work with them instead of being controlled by them. This is the path to mental mastery.
