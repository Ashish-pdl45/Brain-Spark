                    <h2>01 // Hierarchies are Universal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Society is structured by hierarchies of competence and power. Understanding these hierarchies is the first step to navigating them. Every organization, every group, every society has a hierarchy. The question is not whether hierarchies exist, but whether they're based on merit or other factors.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Those at the top of hierarchies have power over resources, information, and outcomes. Those at the bottom have less power and less freedom. This is not inherently evil. It's natural. What matters is mobility—the ability to move up the hierarchy through competence and effort.
                    </p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>02 // Power and Information Control</h2>
                    <p>
                        Control of information is control of power. Those who own the media, those who control the narrative, those who have access to information first—these people have enormous power. This is why media companies are so valuable. They don't sell news. They sell influence.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Governments control information. Corporations control information. Special interest groups control information. The person who understands how information flows, how narratives are constructed, and how perception is managed—that person understands how power actually works in the modern world.

                    <h2>03 // Money as an Amplifier</h2>
                    <p>
                        Money is a neutral amplifier. It makes you more of what you already are. A generous person with money becomes more generous. A stingy person with money becomes more stingy. Money is a tool, not a master. It's a means, not an end.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The obsession with money often comes from confusion about what money actually does. Money doesn't buy happiness. Research is clear on this. Beyond the point where your basic needs are met, more money doesn't correlate with more happiness. What money does is give you options. It gives you freedom. It gives you security.
                    </p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>04 // Value, Not Effort</h2>
                    <p>
                        The world rewards value, not effort. A person can work 60 hours a week and be poor. Another person can work 10 hours a week and be wealthy. The difference is not how hard they work. It's how much value they create.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        To create value, you need to solve problems that people care about, do it better than anyone else, and communicate that value effectively. This is why the highest-paid people are rarely the hardest workers. They're the people who create the most value. Learn to think in terms of value creation, and you'll understand how the world actually works.
